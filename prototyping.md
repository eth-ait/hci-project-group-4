# Prototyping ideas
2018-10-25

Each prototype will address the features of:
 - A Main/Landing page
 - The practicing feature - what he user sees when actually practicing
 - The diary feature

Additionally look at the ideas from [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1lp8kTtNNL11OaOj7rqZEuaVl0SLD0_f8) and prototype 3+ additional features.

Keeping in mind the feedback from Ivan, the presentation, and the Personas we will create a prototype each.
In particular Ivan's enthusiasm for 'gamification' and a 'progress bar' like thing.

**NEXT WEEK** we will mix and match the different prototypes, features/pages so try to conform to A6 paper size as one screen unit.

## Evaluation

Try to get some random people to use the prototypes and note their reactions.
