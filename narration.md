## 0.01Intro

Musicians know that structured, focussed practice is key to making efficient improvement.
But precious practice time often ends up wasted.  Either through endless distractions.... or just
struggling to recall what they really need to work on to improve.

It does not matter whether you are studying music in the conservatories or a hobbyist; staying motivated and focussed in pursuit of your goals is hard.
