# Prototyping ideas
2018-10-25

Each prototype will address the features of:
 - A Main/Landing page
 - The practicing feature - what he user sees when actually practicing
 - The diary feature

Keeping in mind the feedback from Ivan, the presentation, and the personas! In particular Ivan's enthusiasm for 'gamification' and a 'progress bar' like thing.  
we will create a prototype each.


**NEXT WEEK** we will mix and match the different prototypes, features/pages so try to conform to A6 paper size as one screen unit.
