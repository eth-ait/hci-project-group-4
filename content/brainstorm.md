#### Motivational
- FBG\$ - how to keep focus
- star rating for motivation
- yawn detector, if losing focus (through listening) notify/order coffee or bring attention back
- Reward dispensers: Gamification, like the tree growing app, for listening to the user and giving some feedback
- Punishment (minor fine if you don't practice like some other apps, homework etc)
- Focus metric - detect focus and keep motivated, emojis 
- Goals

#### Feedback
- 'Intelligent' metronome - visualises/changes pitch/volume if not in time

- Play, listen, grade - loop: Play a phrase, listen, grade, repeat
- Colour feedback, for score, for recording, etc

#### Gimmicks
- Playstation VR support - for singstar
- Cut out person / and put in a different 'visual setting' - make it fun, visualise why you are practicing
- Actual piano, integrate with a piano for playback, or piano
- robot that does that plays how you should play
