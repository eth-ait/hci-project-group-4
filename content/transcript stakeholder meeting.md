## Transcription of the first meeting with Ivan Basic at ZHdK to discuss the project
The transcript was made by an automated tool an does not represent the discussion word by word. 
Furthermore, the meeting is split up in two parts due to recording time limits of the transcriptor.

#### Part I
Unknown  0:00  
wasn't recording,

Unknown  0:13  
we get distracted by this whole thing of art and artists, you know. And we we can't be bothered to. I'm generalizing, of course. But that's the general problem, that oftentimes we get lost in our art. And when it comes to basic planning,

Unknown  0:29  
we encounter problems. And practicing is a very, should be a very organized process. So to say, you focus on one problem, you repeat it, and you repeated every time with different

Unknown  0:44  
with different options, which would turn out find out and then you choose the one which fits the best, right, and then you have to repeat it. So it stays with you. And so, and oftentimes, I feel that we are our own unorganized in structuring the process and structuring the time. Because easily, what can happen is that you get lost, you lose six hours of your time, basically just running in circles, then by by themselves, you're dead. Because there is a lot of also craft and a lot of emotional output, and what then you have lost the day, so to say, and also with, with systems like this one is where you have two hours, so to say, per session, and you have to return it's very important that you know how to use these two hours. And actually the girl when the colleague of mine, she was probably the resting, which is, of course, fine. But oftentimes, when you walk in the afternoon, you see more people in smartphones and actually working in something. And, you know, that can also be a source of destruction, which comes from not really having a clear strategy, how and when to do what I mean,

Unknown  1:45  
you can intervene. And when you say you get lost in practicing, like, how is how is like, practice hours? How are those semi structured because, like, in our case, you just have like, some sort of exercises you can go in and through. And I didn't know how to get lost in practicing. You know what I mean? Um,

Unknown  2:08  
yes. Yeah, that's a good question. Um, well, it's, it's, it is sort of like that, so to say, with your exercises, something relatable in this view, that would be the compositions, you're working on the pieces and musical pieces. And these are kind of set of in this in this particular case, they are, so to say, your exercises, which all have a set of tasks you have to accomplish. I mean, they're more but let's, let's downgrade to that. And but inside, if you encounter a problem, first of all, you can encounter technical problems that you can't do it. Or if you're a singer, consecutive year player can't move your hands properly to to, to have to have it in time or whatever, then you first have to deal with that, to see what the problem is, and to try to solve it. And then to for your body to remember it. And then comes the artistry, what am I communicating about? Am I efficient enough, is my message clear? Do I change temperature pulse so much that it's no longer traced. So So that's, that's what what I mean, by structuring the problems we might have. Because oftentimes, for instance, you could start off with a technical problem, then you get lost. So to send taken away by by some, some other criteria. For instance, if you were doing an exercise, and then you see something, we tree which you relate with something else, and then you start thinking about that and do something else. And then you realize you're somewhere completely

Unknown  3:36  
over doing some like parts of the whole, so

Unknown  3:39  
to say, or even moving the whole focus to different bank. And I believe, maybe not all musicians would agree with me. But I believe that

Unknown  3:50  
everything is very organized at the same I mean, my father is electrical engineer. So I guess I took that from him. But everything even in artist

Unknown  4:02  
to be there which kind of fall under some laws, for instance, the pulse in music was always has to go regularly. And if you move a lot that says, if you were listening to I don't know tech nore, a rock song, where the where the basis would always place each bead somewhere completely awesome, you at some point, you couldn't listen to them anymore. So it's very structured. And the way of working should also be very structured in order to achieve the result. Right. So.

Unknown  4:30  
So that's, that's actually what I had the idea of doing with this practice up. First of all, I was thinking that considering that we are so unorganized as musicians and we had this place holes are the structuring,

Unknown  4:46  
it's a must, and it be great if you're already so dependent of our phones, or software of, of technology to implement it for good news for us. Because basically, there is a there is the whole there is a big gap between sort of, say, musicians are kind of in on that traditional side of the spectrum and technology, which is, I mean, inevitably, inevitably going forward. And a lot of times, even with the pianos, you know, the club universe and everything, many musicians are completely against them. Although for practicing, it's very useful. So

Unknown  5:25  
I don't think that musicians themselves or so to say, flexible enough for that, and that's why I think it's a good idea to see what we could do, because not much has been done. So just say

Unknown  5:35  
so. So it's more about when to practice and like, what to or what to do instead of like, telling you how good you play the song.

Unknown  5:46  
Well, that would be a second level. So to say, let's, let's start from the first and that is just I would start from just making it all systematic. So to say, you know, on airplanes, I find that very interesting. They have checklists for different parts of flight. I know how much you know, and it's all very plans so they have to go every time I mean, they might have 10 days.

#### Part II
Unknown  0:01  
Discuss.

Unknown  0:02  
So sort of say more than actually there is eating, we have other lectures, which lecture is really lectures. But individual stuff is more consultation. It's like a mentor, when you're working on

Unknown  0:17  
when you're working in

Unknown  0:18  
a thesis,

Unknown  0:20  
you want to ask to focus more on consultation part or they did individual

Unknown  0:26  
it, we could, if it were to focus on the individual practice part of the work the work parts, which enables you to get to the level to, to work to, to bring it to a lesson or greater concert stage, or the thing which can,

Unknown  0:48  
which can, which can help you actually get there individually. So to make systematic yoga, and then what the teacher says, That's to him that's outside

Unknown  0:58  
for you. It's an option to include the professor and

Unknown  1:03  
like working out of checkpoints mentioned earlier.

Unknown  1:06  
Yes, the possibility

Unknown  1:08  
it could be a possibility, but that's down to the students to say, to, to discuss and to see what are the major points, then again, there is a problem of our professors have a systematic overview, but then it's up to the student to systematized all the things that's one says,

Unknown  1:27  
I want a more connected sounds. So to say, that's your general should you should work on this, it's up to the student to say, say to himself, okay, I will get that by flying slowly by listening to each node. And then he can input such things to checklists in our for having different stages of Work Zone building up a strategy need necessarily come from the teacher Delete to me, but mostly from the from the inventive thinking of the street,

Unknown  1:56  
Jennifer,

Unknown  2:02  
one check on the checklist to be checked off one

Unknown  2:09  
you're working on it and it's done and check forever? Or is it possible to combat

Unknown  2:16  
it is possible to come back and actually be good that would be I mean, if, if it were able to

Unknown  2:26  
be created, one could also have have it on a daily basis that each day is a new templates or say, but also that in some sort of a database, you could also revert to, and then go back and say, okay, on this date, for instance, the first of October, I did this, this, this, this, I didn't manage to do this decided to a certain point. And then for instance, as you say, but on the 15th, if I look at the same progress, I did this, I'm much more satisfied with this. I click this as well, it'd be good if it were possible, right? Keep going back

Unknown  3:01  
to you, would you say that everyone knows beforehand, beginning of the day, this is why achieving these other things? Or they sometimes sit down what am I gonna do today,

Unknown  3:14  
I mean, you said there's no given thing by the professor,

Unknown  3:18  
it is something that you think the students already have an idea or

Unknown  3:23  
they should brainstorm the idea for sure. Before before starting. That's

Unknown  3:28  
the essence of any

Unknown  3:30  
work which relies on development development as its as its as its purpose. So before starting, I would actually brainstorm as a student, and then say, today, I need to achieve this, this, this and this, and that piece. And let's see, and then let's see how that works out

Unknown  3:50  
shoes, maybe from a menu or writing or whatever, and then get it

Unknown  4:32  
either way, you're going to come to both have encountered both of these problems, that you have a limited amount of time, right? For instance, I have an hour and a half to go, and let's do the maximum out of this out and you set a time time limit or you have a whole day and in your city, I really want to focus on this one thing to like, get it done. So to encounter both both said,

Unknown  4:52  
What do you think about skills that people need to have that want to use this app? Like, do you have to be in a special program like almost professional musician? Or is it like for everyone would just pick up an instrument and tries to learn it

Unknown  5:14  
be good if we could have post so to say that it's an open thing once you know, because it would help also someone who would like to pick up a guitar, I don't want to pick a girl or something, and something doesn't come come out. And then like, Oh, I you know, but let's, I mean, I would rather focus on professional musicians, because that's a more complex set of sort of anything we have to do. Because with amateurs, I think the main issue there is how to approach them to make the whole approach and the whole interface of the solver approachable to them, and appealing to them realize, I mean, anyways, we're in the, in the sector in this in this thing, and right, I mean, we would go with anything, so to say, but that's the main but I mean, speaking on the level of the things you need to include professionals asked for a much, much more elaborate and much more complex set of things, it's just

Unknown  6:17  
a different set of things after I mean, you like you said, you, you have to learn the stuff different sort of, you have to learn how our notes play are going much more sophisticated,

Unknown  6:31  
stretchable, too much more sophisticated level and with amateurs mostly how no notes are played, and in what way to certain degree, but the whole way it's presented to them needs to be different and sort of say, with professionals, sorry, with amateurs, I I believe the whole thing would need to have a sort of a tutorial

Unknown  6:51  
aspect to it, right?

Unknown  6:53  
Jewish

Unknown  6:54  
people, I mean, there's somebody would probably don't know this, but how do people currently approach to see how do people tell me approached

Unknown  7:03  
a practice

Unknown  7:06  
exam date of

Unknown  7:10  
it must be some people,

Unknown  7:11  
of course, of course, there is, will, for instance, what I would start from is playing through link through a certain piece at the beginning of the day, once you're in the level that you can play through the first stage, of course, work on anything is to learn it. So you go either from you analyze the score, you go bar by bar, learning it, seeing what the problems are, the specific things are than bigger chunks, and at the very end, you can you kind of try to make it from the top to the bottom in one goal. Once you're there, start playing through, I would play through and then after I played, I would go back and see holodeck is turn out to Am I satisfied with how it sounds first, am I satisfied with the organization of the peace with the pulse with what I'm saying then if not, why not to actually compare lot too I had problems

Unknown  8:05  
performing the listener

Unknown  8:06  
is trying to move more basics with things you're saying, You're saying do I and headline, I tend to I like the time or whatever else is there something you might write down was this just for I mean, how, like, more more basic

Unknown  8:23  
specific

Unknown  8:25  
you it is written down. And one of the things I discussed with the system but it was on the on the level of having sort of a gadgets that are built in one of them for this feedback stuff was a metronome, having a metronome, you know what I'm actually miss having it built in the app. So to see where you would set a temple and it will, there is a sort of a thing called a temporary condition. metronome apps either you adopt or itself tries to follow the beats once you establish a B and then it can when you're done to give you a feedback of how how much you divert and fluctuates in between does will also be useful acid in this feedback part of it so to say but

Unknown  9:10  
or having this is I think a really easy thing to have it be great having a recording device built in the so to say that you can just press on record and record I mean okay there is not a recorder and there is but I think in any anything you do one is reluctant to use things if you have to go out and then click another thing and and then you're on more like

Unknown  9:36  
yeah and it's it's a waste of time I'm bothered I can't be bothered to do that and if it were all built in one thing but she basically that would even give you moral principles you just like click there and say record and then you can listen afterwards and this thing could as you said be very centralized thing in order to to give you all the feedback you need

Unknown  9:56  
but going back even even more

Unknown  10:00  
you say like these my goals and it's a limit to how much I can

Unknown  10:07  
I just want to know so

Unknown  10:13  
you say you have these goals or maybe play through something maybe before you can play through something you're what you want to achieve that day? Is that something that you just hasn't keeping your head or is it

Unknown  10:26  
down or how would you write this down or other existing apps out there

Unknown  10:31  
I don't think there are too many existing apps at least I don't know them

Unknown  10:35  
I know when I was learning practice diving

Unknown  10:39  
into something that the people

Unknown  10:41  
okay some to also after listening right everything Collins course and we try to systematized what that has been about him but you have to focus on I mean of course there you're right there is a part of a break a student or the person using it would have to do in terms of writing down everything that needs to be going I pulled together

Unknown  11:01  
like turned out phones didn't exist will never going to be having people come to me

Unknown  11:08  
what we want to achieve now they just don't even entirely mostly in their mind and but how about the people who don't

Unknown  11:16  
lie? Suppose the writings course we're either gonna have something that really needs to be sure that I won't forget I write it we have a set of margins

Unknown  11:28  
or simply use words like here Teck, Teck, Teck, Teck Teck Teck and that's how that's how

Unknown  11:35  
do you think it's possible that we could have a look at that just just if you don't mind, I mean, you can just email us later.

Unknown  11:44  
Or we can, we can go downstairs when we're done, we should be good to show you

Unknown  11:49  
all the things and we can really, you know, get

Unknown  11:54  
Yeah. But so to say if we if we talk about these very basic things that make a performance performance in the musical aspect. First of all, that's both the main thing that's how the beats fall rhythm. The second one, the precision of rhythm than going to the melody as a whole sector you have the articulation is how you play certain certain number of nodes, lead software play harder, if they detach, they're connected, then you have the

Unknown  12:28  
then you have phrasing like in speaking, what is your main point? Where do you go to where to go from or these are kind of criteria, then you have the projects that is small, simple fluctuations, but versus flow fluctuations inside the palace. For instance, if you speed up the tackling slow down, but the measure is the set, so the same, but the tiny bit of course, in these are all very basic set of skills, you need to have to say, these are main points, and these are main point and then only comes interpretation. So how does that all of that fit to my

Unknown  13:06  
other sort of point of interpretation is probably best to leave for the one who plays

Unknown  13:11  
kind of, but it'd be good if, if the software would open up these questions. For instance, there's three questions written down that you can provide answers to, because you can get lost those

Unknown  13:21  
characteristics. It seems like they're measurable, somehow

Unknown  13:26  
they are they are, and that's why I think everything can be systematized okay? And

Unknown  13:30  
but the interpretation can be measured to or not, because that's what all this objective subject, okay, so so it's like, you kind of want the app to provide data on which an interpretation can be made more easily. So you could be great look on this part of the play, and I don't know like

Unknown  13:53  
like a hive Tempe or whatever you said before, just like some, some set of characteristics meet you can argue about it to interpret afterwards. Yes,

Unknown  14:05  
or basically, if you any feedback, public goods provided, you know what to do with it. For instance, you know, in certain things, you can't fluctuate and all that you say, Okay, good at all. But but in certain other things, it's more liberals, it would all have to come back for the final decision to the human but that's the point

Unknown  14:25  
when I was playing

Unknown  14:29  
something that was important listening to music right and saying these other interpretations and saying how you want your interpretation

Unknown  14:40  
you see that

Unknown  14:44  
do you take notes on your when you listen to me saying I like I like they keep to speak tempo here.

Unknown  14:53  
phrasing here is the right

Unknown  14:55  
idea. I don't know. Sure. I keep the momentum so to say,

Unknown  14:59  
but that's a great idea of having it written down. See, some teachers do ask for that you have a various particulars.

Unknown  15:07  
What others from Peking yours for

Unknown  15:14  
every level from an Apple Computer

Unknown  15:21  
an interpretation Stanley, sort of where you get more

Unknown  15:25  
Well, yeah, but they would from the start starts usually from the interpretation. What exactly and then from I mean, the point of view wouldn't be down and then upwards, but rather from uptown, if it doesn't work, why doesn't it work? And then it's a question where you stop, it was a very basic things you can go through bit more develop things, I mean,

Unknown  15:50  
should should, the basics should be covered. And

Unknown  15:52  
that's how it works. And

Unknown  15:57  
usually dictate give you feedback. I mean, we can feature solutions, right? There's obviously don't buy into it in terms of when they give you feedback on

Unknown  16:05  
when they give you feedback on these very basic things. They work as your characters

Unknown  16:11  
here, you changed me too much

Unknown  16:13  
and not content with your articulation. I'm not satisfied with this, but that and then only when it all fits, you can talk about ideas and whether the idea works on but I think that's a bit of outside the scope, right? They can't include that, because we don't know everyone has particular set of ideas. But on these very basic organizing side, I think we can we can make some progress

Unknown  16:42  
to this question to the skill. So in the apps, would you would you want to have some kind of skills where you you work on over multiple songs, or more pieces, and there's pair piece like a set of attributes you want to fit? Or is it like all mixed together and only person or Pepys, Becky says, some some some characteristic characteristics which you have to learn on every piece, or is it barium focused on her piece?

Unknown  17:20  
I think it is set of set of basic Let's kill so to say, which we listen, they are applicable to every piece, but in a different way

Unknown  17:30  
into each section of a piece, but in a different way. Should should it be so on the same if the piece itself requires such a thing. So I think the basics would be the same everywhere. And maybe you can even group different set of set of pieces that their goal is something a particular things did you play the piano?

Unknown  17:50  
Yes. attitudes.

Unknown  17:52  
Yeah, it yields are mainly made as exercises, right? That's what it means. Interesting,

Unknown  18:00  
I suppose

Unknown  18:02  
they are to lead you to a higher level of a technical abilities be musical understanding. So and then you can group them for instance, if they are to be on a technical side, you can say, okay, the main main goal of the five elements I'm playing used to develop my small technique, as will be my finger technique and everything. And then you could say, but every child is different. So to say, they determine sort of set the tempo, which is different, different articulation usually. And so it's a bit tricky to really generalize that much. But the default thing is it for instance, in the foot, I mean, just to go with the football team, you always have 11 players, right. But there are different in Chelsea or Arsenal, or I don't know if it's a Basel or whatever, but the positions are more or less the same. And the tactics one, the one the tactics, one users, so to say, the formation and everything that's up to the manager, or the professor so say, but kind of everyone has the same goal, I thought to concede one, and to score. So that that's pretty much similar to how how this works with four different pieces.

Unknown  19:10  
So China,

Unknown  19:14  
he's learning those pieces, something more social, like do you imagine it more of like, a platform where I can look like, what you like, your process? Or is it really like individual or up to the individual level,

Unknown  19:31  
although the, this would be great, the, the, the possibility of an open right

Unknown  19:38  
and open data that the great because you could learn from other people,

Unknown  19:43  
but the thing is, with musicians and future track I mean, we could develop as a concept but musicians also have this side of kind of keeping some things to their own and especially in the work process not necessarily because they don't want to share but usually we have a problem with them being embarrassment they're not on their highest level and then I'm not sure how much it group but as a concept great,

Unknown  20:02  
really me sharing the minute you know that or does it is very

Unknown  20:09  
few and maybe even can set lists for them the perfect especially practice this now, and

Unknown  20:17  
especially on a gymnasium level. So you say University something different right? In Egypt University teachers don't think you're right. I mean, compare your electricity unity to high school you did, it's quite different, right? Here they are, they have 500 people, they can devote their time humanism classes as much smaller they can devote to each one. It's kind of similar here. Yeah, but on this at a younger age, or on a lower level. So to say this was be great to provide feedback to someone who is instructing you, and that someone could also imagine that what I was talking to talk about in terms of what could be built in assets to provide feedback. I believe that's also an interesting part right to the bank of the app. I mean, not only list sure how your your supervisor would look, if it's all aspects and then click maybe let's do basic, but on feedback, we were talking about the building recording device, which would be able to just record and then did you played silver resolve, but then all the feedback you would have to give to yourself, so to say, I have to give to it. But anyways, that would be very useful. The second one we were talking about was a metronome, definitely built in metrics just to click that you don't have to leave the app but steady and it'd be great if we could also implement this or you can do projects

Unknown  21:39  
implement this sort of Temple recognition and how much it diverts Yes, it would have to be very much Google what apps there are and are out there and what sort of software has been developed and how much knowledge even if I suppose you could leave a blank box, right, if if it's not obtainable or something, but it's possible to implement Yes? recognition. I mean, I believe we told technology

Unknown  22:05  
for before, during or it's

Unknown  22:10  
like, just recorded and read the you're able to replay or is the more like, that might

Unknown  22:21  
make possible both

Unknown  22:23  
Amai something similar to this device that records and credit notes.

Unknown  22:29  
Yeah, and recognizes the speech writer transcribes I mean, I guess,

Unknown  22:34  
well,

Unknown  22:35  
no way. I mean, basically, a recording device, per se, will be great to have it, but it

Unknown  22:43  
is because I mean, I think,

Unknown  22:46  
well as I'm a pianist, let's make it for the piano. Well, for now, a

Unknown  22:51  
violin, for instance, even have a problem with intonation maybe as well, but the process will be the same look, I mean, it's

Unknown  22:58  
the same effects. I played the trumpet and piano and

Unknown  23:01  
so, you know, all set of

Unknown  23:02  
I needed playing the trumpet, I can record it anyways,

Unknown  23:07  
just start.

Unknown  24:07  
And one other thing is, so you talked about, I mean, I assume you do scales arpeggios, right? You know,

Unknown  24:15  
this be something to be considered

Unknown  24:19  
a basic

Unknown  24:22  
go down. Yeah,

Unknown  24:24  
yes. What I mean, is, this is this something that you want to be able to receive feedback

Unknown  24:31  
that be great, because it's very measurable problems. That's not an interpretation, that's just the technical skills that you can play from here to here in a certain tempo with no deviations with a simulation quality,

Unknown  24:43  
that be great. Let's start from that. So to say, that's a great idea, arpeggios and skills, there's set of techniques, which are to be as even as possible, so to say, in all terms, temple and sound

Unknown  24:57  
for feedback, that'd be a great start. And then it becomes more complex. But I mean, when you swing these huge, I mean, for least I know, for the trumpet, I can't remember the piano, we had a short little things way, it was just sort of articulation was the whole thing maybe was just a cartoon triplets,

Unknown  25:17  
you know, something with the whole focus was on just being able to do this in the best way possible.

Unknown  25:24  
And still sort of measurable

Unknown  25:27  
it is, and it's better to downgrade to something that's really measurable, because,

Unknown  25:33  
you know, when you when you cannot, to musicians, with the idea of everything being systematic, they say, but art is, and we have too many chime in there, right. But I mean, to very beginning on a very basic scale, it is all system. And that's the thing with, with more complex things, I'm not sure how much of feedback we could get from

Unknown  25:56  
this type of feedback. We don't have to type we can give feedback, but we can leave the interpretation of the feedback exit playing. That's what you're talking about. Because it's not that clear.

Unknown  26:09  
Okay, good. You know, what I do I do you do any of this, you give data, and then it's up to the person to interpret that

Unknown  26:17  
data to us. That's what I felt were talking about.

Unknown  26:20  
Exactly. Because no one can tell even on the human the human level, no one can tell you for interpretation apart from yourself. So to say, I mean, a very skilled person, Kendra audience can but in terms of ideas, and where you want it, I mean, only, you know what you want, right?

Unknown  26:36  
I mean, yeah, as long as it's

Unknown  26:38  
if it's for you, maybe just this changing

Unknown  26:42  
over the course of learning a piece like this, sort of, if you have an interpretation in mind is this changing, or it is stick to one want to like, just

Unknown  26:54  
from my experience, it does change. But when you lock it at certain points, and that's usually from midway through to the end of the work on a piece of the say before the before it can go out for performance. So to say, I usually divide my work into three stages. The first one is the very beginning, where I tried to learn the text and try to learn as much as I can about the text text is the score. The second stage, which is usually quite considerably longer is just getting it into my, into my system, so to say, getting getting my hands and getting it in my mind and working on different details. And that's where the idea of interpret interpretation develops, like, I want this here. But how does that fit in the whole idea. And then when you acquire all of these set of skills, then basically move to the advanced part where you play through mostly where you contemplate where you think, what is the what is really the message I want to send, and are there some things that have to change to fit and mostly the interpretation is locked somewhere here. And then when you go out and perform, it'll change over the course of time, especially if you leave it for a year and then come back. But once you have an idea doesn't change that much.

Unknown  28:03  
Can you come back to the using this three states to me come back to how you go about doing the first

Unknown  28:09  
Yes, I take the score from the library,

Unknown  28:14  
I tried to listen to a piece to do already well established interpretation to get a sense, sometimes I do that sometimes they don't, what I want to test myself how much I can do it on my own. But anyways, be good to check right at one point, then I try reading the score going through it at the piano or on the train. And you just read the score and say, Uh huh. This is the same as this is the same as that. And then I tried to structure the thing. We also have our

Unknown  28:40  
there is a subject to cost structure analysis, basically, really, music is also structured and first team, second theme, recap, whatever. And then you kind of tried to make skeleton of it in your head, then you sit at the piano or the instrument and you start playing. And then with that plane, you you try to memorize and to already working with, and that's how it works. And quite honestly, I can't tell you what really the psychological processes of learning that because I don't know what I don't know, as at one point, it just clicks. And I know, I mean, after enough repetition and focused repetition, but it's like writing, right? You can't really tell at what point you know it, you just know, you know it? Sure. So

Unknown  29:22  
into the second stage,

Unknown  29:26  
well, the second stage starts parallel to the end of the first you already start working on some things like I don't know this passage yet by court. But I see there is a problem, let me work on it. And then through that, through that repetition comes in. So they kind of they emerge at some point, but really, you can tell when the third stage becomes because then you really do have no more problems. Or even if you do, they're easily solved. So you really know when that starts. Yeah,

Unknown  29:57  
in

Unknown  30:00  
this is about stages are you considering that in implementing

Unknown  30:04  
is more just we just want to get the whole picture the whole picture

Unknown  30:09  
much. I'm sorry, I don't know how much clearer I am.

Unknown  30:13  
I mean, that's kind of

Unknown  30:18  
the core of every every three stages. We will

Unknown  30:22  
go through all the stages. But um, yeah, I'm trying to, to kind of, but really whatever the questions are asked him because

Unknown  30:35  
he already have I think

Unknown  30:36  
we should have asked this question

Unknown  30:40  
was so

Unknown  30:45  
similar,

Unknown  30:47  
similar applications or techniques or whatever that you have used, or

Unknown  30:53  
I haven't used any practicing absolute to say, I don't think it's too developed sector at least items. And it's not even if there are some they're not really brought to all of us to and I mean, I would know i mean the sector and I'm not completely shut off from the it but there I was once in a seminar over guy who teaches in Singapore is American who kind of

Unknown  31:23  
who kind of gave me the initial ad, he had this concept of an interactive classroom and he had a work concept for his class for his students he presented in the center where he would really write down and he would go through all stages of work for instance, he would say articulation that's a set of problem which goes under the big group falling drop down menu

Unknown  31:50  
technique

Unknown  31:52  
so to say fingertip, Nick articulation, and then he would list on all sorts of articulation. And then he would little bit extreme, but he would make their students really learn all these by heart, and his names and his, the way he named them, and then they would just use abbreviations in in, in lessons like, Oh, you need

Unknown  32:12  
FF our first finger reflects, that's the only one I remember that's a bit extreme. But give me an idea of everything actually being everything is

Unknown  32:23  
everything has the option of being organized, so to say, and that's the only thing I encountered so to say, with with such such a thing, but I don't think he he was thinking of the practicing process, and especially not of the of the application being able to give you a feedback

Unknown  32:39  
hearing, you're saying, if it was a bit extreme, do you think you're saying that you had a me in different categories, that's not how you can learn it is

Unknown  32:47  
it on the other hand, I think the screen part is that he imposed his all the names he gave to each of them to to them. And that's not necessarily has to be how it's done, I would like that each user of the software would have the option of naming the categories, for instance, they would be organizing these basic functions, but you could also set like, maybe you don't find for your particular set of defeat, you have six, you don't have seven, or you have five, and then be great. If you can also fill in yours, you know, that it's, it's flexible in these terms, because there are no two teachers are there no, two musicians who have the same view of the other thing, if they started with the same teacher from the same school, they might have the same overview, but everyone has their experience. And then they say, this was good what I learned, but this could be more developed. And then, you know, everyone is different. So to say, That's might be good for it to be open to certainly. But that's that also they were it's a bit from

Unknown  33:51  
what we can do today, what do you have, like some certain if you compare it with the drop down menu? So to say that you would have some

Unknown  34:02  
over groups like technique and whatever interpretation articulation or something, and then use it good

Unknown  34:14  
in this

Unknown  34:15  
set his own goals? Or that'd be great. Yes. So you have a skeleton in the beginning, already? Yes. Which you fill in on

Unknown  34:24  
your own? Okay, yes, that'd be perfect.

Unknown  34:26  
How common is it from musicians to play more than one instrument,

Unknown  34:34  
so So, so professionals, not really not really focus on one thing, if I know,

Unknown  34:41  
because it's two or three people here in this building, students will play more than one instrument, and I know only one or two really can play both good.

Unknown  34:49  
But most I mean place I went to

Unknown  34:54  
I were expected to learn another instrument, not not, that's

Unknown  35:00  
that's a very often in the, in the early stages of learning music. But once you're in your exit, even, I mean, I did my bachelor insurgent, they'll get on there and there are there was a thing you know, we could be our studies could be funded by the budget, so to say, of all the states, so they would be free, but once you want to the second instrument to that are a second student young, you would have to be so in a way, you're not even encouraged to take up if you want something

Unknown  35:27  
because, you know, we can be quite a big deal

Unknown  35:32  
because I recommend you want to keep them separate them when you learn an instrument. So yeah, I'm just from an implementation standpoint, it would mean quite a lot.

Unknown  35:45  
But then can you could just select a few different profiles. Yeah, let them instrument to relate Exactly. And some stuff will be shared, which will, for

Unknown  35:55  
instance, let's say

Unknown  35:58  
harpsichord organ and piano keyboard instruments still, there were different in terms of how they make sound, and you can do all the things you know, I need to them. But let's say the finger technique is all the same, pretty much the same in all, and if you're a problem of playing scale up, that's the problem you have to have on each of these instruments. Right. But how you played is a different thing. Yeah, so yeah, that's, that's basically that

Unknown  36:24  
we got some the basic idea. Want to tell us?

Unknown  36:29  
I don't know, you have some more. I don't know if I we get more out of this conversation?

Unknown  36:34  
Yeah, me?

Unknown  36:37  
Yes. Please do not know, at all and more

Unknown  36:41  
music standpoint, more from the technical standpoint, as usual, with this kind of stuff. I'm already trying to implement it

Unknown  36:51  
maybe after feeling as well, when you're like, thinking about music, it just wanna put it down and start working on it.

Unknown  37:01  
First of all, we will probably

Unknown  37:06  
Yeah, you said you want to know

Unknown  37:10  
what would be like the platform for that would be

Unknown  37:14  
just a web page? Would it be like a web app? Would it be an iPhone apps? Would it be an Android app? Because all those things are really different?

Unknown  37:27  
And what do you think? Or more generally, what do you would you want it to be accessible from just a phone? Or is the necessary that you could access it from any device anywhere?

Unknown  37:39  
Haha. Now Okay. Well,

Unknown  37:43  
I To be honest, I would like although I titled the stakeholder,

Unknown  37:48  
but I would like that we kind of negotiate I mean that we agree on that. It's not necessarily what I want, but also what's doable? So to say, right, and what you think would be good because this is more of your domain, right? I don't know. I mean, I have an iPhone, I had an Android and really there's a lot of people have all sorts of platforms

Unknown  38:08  
and I don't know within the web web app be most accessible to all

Unknown  38:15  
said they're mostly on their cell phones would make sense to be something Exactly. You don't have to

Unknown  38:21  
that was my second year because bring a laptop

Unknown  38:26  
internet

Unknown  38:27  
web apps run on mobile processors, that wouldn't be

Unknown  38:31  
you know, not have internet in the practice, you do have Wi Fi down there. Okay, saying Jamie founders worldwide mean, I reckon it would be nice if you,

Unknown  38:41  
you know, planted at your laptop, because

Unknown  38:45  
maybe that's a

Unknown  38:46  
lot more accessible when you have a keyboard, and you can actually write down stuff and use your mouse at least I work a lot faster.

Unknown  38:56  
Maybe have some, I think

Unknown  38:59  
the practice that is the most if we go into practice,

Unknown  39:02  
yeah, sure,

Unknown  39:04  
is the coolest thing. And until you have that, how you actually put stuff in, I mean, it's important, but but if there's no functionality, that is my point, and even focus on

Unknown  39:16  
definitely the smartphone would be the best option for using it. So to say, because that's the thing we all have. I forgot it once in August is when such a stress like my family, and then you realize how much you're dependent of it. And I would, I would focus on that. But I don't know which platform is better. I mean, to start with just one and then it can also be the language can be translated to the other one rights.

Unknown  39:37  
I guess one one, like the project has, perhaps to have a practice your next project. Yeah,

Unknown  39:45  
so long to change.

Unknown  39:49  
I mean, I didn't know how this class

Unknown  39:58  
and also, I mean, a smartphone, so has a microphone to be glorified.

Unknown  40:03  
It has

Unknown  40:04  
a camera has everything. So basically, it's a small computer. So I would, I would work on that as well. What else do we have?

Unknown  40:16  
So

Unknown  40:18  
let's go movies. Are there any other technical stuff? Yeah,

Unknown  40:22  
no, no, they will. Probably a few more. But perfect, but just I mean, at the beginning, we will do it by pen and paper anyway. And we will show you like, what if I understood the whole project correctly, which I hope will I

Unknown  40:42  
will do it on pen and paper first, and then we'll show you like, yeah, it's like, our

Unknown  40:50  
main focus, like right now will be on the interaction part, you know, how do the app itself is designed and how it should look like, and we will put that down with pen and paper and we'll show it to you, and you will give your input and perfect, perfect,

Unknown  41:10  
yes. How I

Unknown  41:13  
understood it. I mean,

Unknown  41:15  
yeah, the first and foremost thing is, whenever something comes up in your

Unknown  41:19  
feedback, or a question or whatever, send me an email. That's, I think the best way to really what whatever. And whenever in terms of you don't have to wait till our official meeting, or whatever, just opened email whenever. And I'll get back to you as soon as I can. And I think all of our dates are all came terms of I'm here. I'm not hearing in November, most of the member, but I think we also have something at the very end. So in any way, you can send it via email. And I'll try to get back to it as soon as I can. But let's put everything just briefly in a nutshell. So the first steps are to make a concept right on paper

Unknown  41:56  
to have an idea already, or maybe I suppose that you will have

Unknown  42:02  
tomorrow we are discussion I guess we have lunch tomorrow in

Unknown  42:06  
the exercise. I think everyone like right now has the basic idea is months apart, Nick,

Unknown  42:13  
I'm just glad to have all of this actually resulted in Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I wasn't too confusing. Or something your air but not not good.

Unknown  42:23  
I knew if he said no, then something was

Unknown  42:28  
confusing.

Unknown  42:30  
Just as it should be. One thing that we see great, actually,

Unknown  42:35  
in the beginning, you talked about this checklist, do you think it would be possible for you to do that, like one day for yourself? And then and then email it to us so we can get an understanding because I have an idea. And it's probably different than your idea.

Unknown  42:55  
Yeah. Okay. And literally think we

Unknown  42:57  
can get to a basic consensus and start walking from there.

Unknown  43:02  
Anyways,

Unknown  43:03  
I've shown you this course of working on this concert. Like for coffee I needed for Friday, and these days, tomorrow's let's say, or later today, I will sit down and write a checklist of the things I need to do

Unknown  43:17  
checklist. Just do write something down the way that you think it should be. Exactly the

Unknown  43:23  
checklist. It's tricky, or

Unknown  43:24  
whatever. Well, I will try just putting it on paper did the work process I believe is important, and what I would stick to and how, and then I will actually try to do it for for that. And I would also try to do it with that piece as well. But in each of these three stages, right. And I guess that would, it would be very useful. I

Unknown  43:44  
mean, that would be the best Adele do that. I mean, anyway, have guys it's time to do that.

Unknown  43:50  
I already have the idea just to put it on

Unknown  43:55  
that or I'll type

Unknown  43:59  
Good. Good. And tomorrow are exercises, right?

Unknown  44:03  
Yes,

Unknown  44:05  
tomorrow's lecture

Unknown  44:06  
and exercise

Unknown  44:10  
thirsty, but your time?

Unknown  44:14  
How much time do you have any way for this? How many? How many courses do you have to take there you have it anytime for this whatsoever for this course. And how much time is it will what time consuming to think it will be in just out of my curiosity depends on what

Unknown  44:29  
the final product should be.

Unknown  44:35  
Right? Because,

Unknown  44:38  
I mean, it's in scope for credit score. So don't expect

Unknown  44:42  
your whole

Unknown  44:44  
like being delivered in this semester. But

Unknown  44:47  
as far as I understand it, it's more

Unknown  44:51  
to be very honest, I'm not sure how, how good it is to say it. But it's better to say it out loud. Look, even when I agreed with the assistant or let's say we teach personal to to be part of this project. I did it more from in my

Unknown  45:09  
curiosity. And so to say my desire to to work with someone on that and to develop the idea but I didn't expect I would get the end product that would be instantly widely used to propel us to the very top of I don't know it sector or musical said music IT sector and then

Unknown  45:26  
you will at some point,

Unknown  45:29  
of course, right. But I didn't. That's not my motivation. So you say my main motivation is to have this, to have people talk about this and to have people work with me on this and try to develop and see how you guys think. And that's, that's more of it. I mean, even if you just come with a skeleton on paper, I would be already so to say satisfied. I mean, my my, my goals would be okay, if someone just would sit down from the IT sector, right. I can call it the guys from the good

Unknown  46:00  
Okay,

Unknown  46:01  
sorry. Yeah,

Unknown  46:03  
yeah, I mean, I just want to see how, how much that would be implement it could be implemented and worked on and what are the limits? And what are the options and what you know, whatever you do is just extra bonus and I'm happy happy with it.

Unknown  46:18  
So, no pressure reading from my side from the i can i can influence that. Sorry.

Unknown  46:26  
Excellent. Good

Unknown  46:29  
mean.

Unknown  46:30  
Is it okay for you if we keep you informed on the whole process? So for you to be and to know what to expect?

Unknown  46:37  
Perfect, perfect. Okay. Yeah, I can know and then I can also think on my own and make sure I'm good. Any other questions? blood type?

Unknown  46:49  
Good luck type Social Security.

Unknown  46:53  
Good for you.

Unknown  46:59  
Okay. That's

Unknown  46:59  
nice consultation.

Unknown  47:02  
Yeah, that's perfect. Great questions

Unknown  47:07  
for you have anything super clear? I mean, by signature kinda you have you had a lot of questions and you were really eager to get to the bottom so I can see that you're kind of motivated. I mean, not kind of our I mean, none in the most positive way. So so

Unknown  47:24  
right.

Unknown  47:26  
Good. I hope it isn't

Unknown  47:27  
too much of a bird. No, no, no. No.
