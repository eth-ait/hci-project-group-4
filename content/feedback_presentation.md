# Ivan presentation feedback

Personas:
Jason and Alana are the personas he is looking for. Alana could represent even younger musicians which are ambitious enough to take it seriously, but not main focus. Jennifer is not his primary group of interest, the teacher side is less important than the musicians side.

## Prototypes:

### Negatives:

- Github too sophisticated for what he has in mind, it seems too idealized to him
- Not everything should be recorded, user should be able to record if he's ready 

### Positives:

+ Checklist
+ Having Project "Folders" to separate between them
+ Sharing recordings with colleagues
+ Show starting time of the exercise session
+ Diary with progress made on individual days
+ Comments on recordings
+ Gamification and rewards
   - Get coins to buy giftcards off MusicHug, Concert or so
   - buy sheet music
