# Last meeting with Ivan

2019-01-18
Everyone in attendance

## Minutes

Showed video and then demonstrated the app.
Seemed interested in the stages part of the app

Ivan: How do I attribute the time spent on the sessions/tasks?

    - set the time for the task within the task.
    - in session screen, we can see how the timer and the tasks relate
    - showed how the linking of the task to the project can be managed â€“ so the time can be correctly attributed.
    - metronome, initial value shown and played not the same (only initially)

Things to be fixed:

    - recording is a feature that should be probably implemented next
    - accessing some of the information in the session page was not there from right clicking which it probably should be

Overall project

    - Visual aspect of the design should be focussed on some more
    - Simplicity should be a bit more key, in the visual aspect
    - An introduction of how to use would be necessary in the current incarnation


The focus on the functionalities for the user were perhaps not as well displayed as they could perhaps be.

## IP Rights

If the app was to go to market we (the hci-project-group-4) would like to be informed, and Oliver would like to have a free copy. Other than this, the IP created by the group we happily leave to Ivan for him to do with what he will.
