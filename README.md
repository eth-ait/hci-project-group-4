## W1: Project description

The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness of practise sessions when preparing for the performance of a musical piece.
From this definition of our goal we understand the target audience to be musicians coming from the whole spectrum of expertise.
Ranging from student to pro, we try to provide a way to plan and keep track of one's journey towards perfectioning each piece.  

## W2: Stakeholder
The project was made in collaboration with Ivan Basic (ZHdK). We met with him in the second week to talk about his ideas and to get a better understanding of the project.
Between the lines we read (other verb?) that some musicians have the problem of not being disciplined or losing focus when practicing. See the [transcript of the meeting](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/transcript%20stakeholder%20meeting.md) for more details.
The project therefore aims to resolve this issue and provide a way to bring structure to the musician's practice sessions.

## W3: Needfinding
This week was about needfinding and getting an even better understanding of the project. 
Through the [affinity clustering](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/affinity%20clustering.md), each member of the group recapitulated the discussion with Ivan and wrote down first observations. This required each team member to think about the meeting and find words for this persional impressions. 
The Observations on the cards got grouped together to form categories of our choice. This process, and sharing the individual
thoughts on each cards, lead us to broughter insights on the situation.

We also invented three individual personas which should serve us as guidance. We created them such that they serve us as
target audience. By describing their situation and therefore their needs, we now have good reference when making decisions.
### The personas
[Jason](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20jesse.pdf), 27, a typical music student looking for an efficient way to study.  
[Alana](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20alana.pdf), 19, an ambitious high school student working towards a music competition while trying to have as much free time as possible.  
[Jennifer](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20jennifer.pdf), 34, a music teacher looking for a way to help her students even when she's not around.


## W4: Ideation

With the help of our personas and a basic understanding of our goal we could now explore the whole designspace we're in.
The idea is to [brainstorm](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/brainstorm.md): thinking in any direction without caring about implementability or any other real world problems. Since there
exist no bad ideas in this context, we had quite a bit of banter. ![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztd5vx7mxQ4AkQU/giphy.gif)

From this we narrowed down and fleshed out three main iprototypes. Since we already had a lot of ideas through the brainstorm and the work done in the weeks before, this task was relatively easy. The hardest part was dumping glorious thoughts which turned out to be not that promising after all. We still tried to create three totaly different prototypes. Each one should solve the problem in it's own way to not miss any perspective. The result was [presented](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/prototypes%20presentation.pdf) the week after in class to get a first review. After minor changes the ideas of our prototypes were presented our stakeholder Ivan.
