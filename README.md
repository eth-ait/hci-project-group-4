## W1: Project description

The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness and focus during practise sessions when preparing for the performance of a musical pieces.
From our goal we understand the target audience to be musicians coming from a whole spectrum of expertise;
ranging from student to professional.
In summary we will try to provide a way to plan and keep track of one's journey towards perfecting each piece.

## W2: Stakeholder

The project is made in collaboration with [Ivan Basic (ZHdK)](https://www.zhdk.ch/person/211783).
We met with him in the second week to talk about his ideas and the project to get a better understanding of the project.
Before meeting we had each individually formed some ideas and understanding of what the project might be about.
This was beneficial as we could present some ideas to Ivan that were not all necessarily relevant to the core ideas of the project but could be relevant in the future.
Meeting  with Ivan was essential for us to really understand what the project was about.
Ivan explained to us also how precious practice time is, as the practice rooms are in high demand, and users only have a limited amount of time.
We came to understand that playing music can deceptively appear -  even to the musician who is playing -  as practicing, but without focus a practice session can be inefficient, and actually waste the time of the musician.
Through our discussion with Ivan, we came to understand that, the core of the problem is that many musicians have the problem with a lack of discipline and often lose focus of the goals of the session when practicing.
The project's primary aim is to resolve this issue and provide a way to bring structure to the musician's practice sessions to ensure the musician's goals, both long-term, and immediate, are be met.
\
We asked Ivan to write down his 'practice process' to gain insight into the long term practice process.
Here are  [transcripts and recordings of the meeting](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/transcript%20stakeholder%20meeting.md) and [Ivan's practice formula](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1enS73yaeMvfAof8zEtGe3URoXVIFXiKN).

## W3: Need-finding and Personas

This week was about need-finding and getting an even better understanding of the project.
Through [affinity clustering](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/affinity%20clustering.md), each member of the group recapitulated the discussion with Ivan and wrote down their first observations.
This required each team member to think about the meeting and find words for their personal impressions.
The Observations on the cards got grouped together to form categories of our choice.
This process, and sharing the individual thoughts on each cards, lead us to better insights on the situation and project as a whole.

![affinity clustering 4](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/affinity_clustering_4.jpeg).

### Personas

We also invented three differing personas which can serve us as guidance.
We created them such that they serve us as target audience.
By describing their situation and therefore their needs, we now have good reference when making decisions.

#### The personas in summary

(Click on the links for a more complete description)

[Jason](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20jesse.pdf), 27, a typical music student looking for an efficient way to study.

[Alana](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20alana.pdf), 19, an ambitious high school student working towards a music competition while trying to have as much free time as possible.

[Jennifer](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20jennifer.pdf), 34, a music teacher looking for a way to help her students even when she's not around.


## W4: Ideation

With the help of our personas and an understanding of our goal we could now explore the whole designspace we are in.
The idea is to [brainstorm](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/brainstorm.md): thinking in any direction without caring about implementability or any other real world problems.
Since there exist no bad ideas in this context, we had both serious ideas and quite a bit of banter that lead us into interesting areas.

From this we narrowed down and fleshed out three main prototypes.
Since we already had a lot of ideas through the brainstorm and the work done in the weeks before, this task was relatively easy.
The hardest part was dumping *glorious thoughts* which turned out to be *not* so promising after all.
Still, we tried to create three totally different prototypes.
Each one tried to solve the problem in it's own way so as not miss any perspective, each combining more combinations of ideas we from the brainstorming process.
The results we [presented](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/prototypes%20presentation.pdf) the week after in class to get a [first feedback](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/feedback_presentation.md).
After minor changes the ideas of our prototypes were presented our stakeholder Ivan.


### W6: Prototypes

As mentioned before, we created three different prototypes which could possibly solve the goal.
When designing them we tried to keep in mind our personas, e.g. *'Alana would not like this ... this is prefect for Jason.'* and the requirements we had derived so far.

#### [10-π](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/ten-pi_app_prototype.pdf)  
- ˈtɛmpiː

An app with inbuilt functionality to plan and keep track of ones progress.

#### [bothofen](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_prototype.pdf) 
- ˈbeɪˌtoʊvən

A small gadget providing deeper insight into the music played and a way to connect with peers or teachers. [sketch 1](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_skizze_1.png), [sketch 2](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_skizze_2.png), [sketch 3](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_skizze_3.png).

#### [π-ano](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/pi-ano_prototype.pdf) -piˈænəʊ

A smart piano including pretty much everything the two prototypes above provide.
/pi

#### Paper Prototypes

After a short discussion with our stakeholder, Ivan, it was clear to everyone that the app serves our goal and users best and that we'd focus on this prototype.
It made sense to us due to it's easy deployment and because almost everyone knows instantly how to use it.
Furthermore, most people carry their phone with them already most of the time and it is capable of solving what we expect it to.
The other prototypes helped us gaining insight into how the goals could also be achieved if portability was not a criteria.
As it is and we thought that we may overshoot the goal with needless complexity for the task with a self-contained physical instance, even though it potentially it could provide much more than an app.

We created multiple paper prototypes of the app to get a feel for it. See the prototypes below:
[PP1](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_1.pdf),
[PP2](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_2.pdf),
[PP3](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_3.pdf),
[PP4](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_4.pdf).

Each team member drew their own paper prototype.
This way each team member created their own first app paper prototype uninfluenced and with their own ideas.
We created a [rough outline](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/prototyping_outline.md) so we could combine the ideas we thought best more easily with each other.
The result was a discussion with each team member already having their own point of view.
We sat down multiple times in the team, talking to potential future users in between, to get a feel what we (and they) needed.
At this stage the prototypes where still low-fi, which made the re-evaluation pretty easy, however at some times it could be hard for users to come to the same understanding of how some of the functionalities might work, e.g. a pulsating screen as a metronome.
We started to code our own app, as the picture of the end software became more clear.
Furthermore, we started to use reference of functionalities of already existing apps that had features we liked.

![Sleeping App Reference](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/sleeping_app_review_1.jpg).
After composing a vision of the project as a whole and producing a coarse prototype getting feedback is required.


### W8: User Study

The exercise was to design and conduct a user study/heuristic evaluation with our prototype.
To get this feedback a user study is required to confirm and refute our assumptions.
We focussed on producing low fidelity prototypes so that we could test different ideas we had and get feedback from potential users.
With this we should assess the usability of our design.



We designed a study and evaluated it.
The [Detailed Study Report](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/detailed_study_report.pdf) contains our hypotheses, the methods we used to checked those and a short summary.
The [Study Evaluation](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/study_evaluation.pdf) shows the result of the study, statistics we extracted out of the data commented on it by us.
We attained the data by conducting the tests described in the detailed study report and wrote down the result in an [Evaluation Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mMPWOriXPx2D7pERDGj-8rZW28IvjL5L10zMLD73cyg/viewform?edit_requested=true).
The raw data can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/excel_raw_study_data.pdf). 
We [presented](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/study_presentation.pdf) the study to the class and to our stakeholder - Ivan - along with the reports.
The study provided us with useful insight as to what we needed to prioritise and some concrete things to change; for example some of the buttons in our test prototype had misleading and confusing names for the task they were intended.
The feedback provided by the user study showed us where the project stands as a whole and gave us a way forward with the project.
