## W1: Project description

The goal of this project is to improve the effectiveness and focus during practise sessions when preparing for the performance of a musical pieces.
From our goal we understand the target audience to be musicians coming from a whole spectrum of expertise;
ranging from student to professional.
In summary we will try to provide a way to plan and keep track of one's journey towards perfecting each piece.

## W2: Stakeholder
The project is made in collaboration with [Ivan Basic (ZHdK)](https://www.zhdk.ch/person/211783).
We met with him in the second week to talk about his ideas and the project to get a better understanding of the project.
Before meeting we had each individually formed some ideas and understanding of what the project might be about.
This was beneficial as we could present some ideas to Ivan that were not all necessarily relevant to the core ideas of the project but could be relevant in the future.
Meeting  with Ivan was essential for us to really understand what the project was about.
Ivan explained to us also how precious practice time is, as the practice rooms are in high demand, and users only have a limited amount of time.
We came to understand that playing music can deceptively appear -  even to the musician who is playing -  as practicing, but without focus a practice session can be inefficient, and actually waste the time of the musician.
Through our discussion with Ivan, we came to understand that, the core of the problem is that many musicians have the problem with a lack of discipline and often lose focus of the goals of the session when practicing.
The project's primary aim is to resolve this issue and provide a way to bring structure to the musician's practice sessions to ensure the musician's goals, both long-term, and immediate, are be met.
\
We asked Ivan to write down his 'practice process' to gain insight into the long term practice process.
Here are  [transcripts and recordings of the meeting](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/transcript%20stakeholder%20meeting.md) and [Ivan's practice formula](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1enS73yaeMvfAof8zEtGe3URoXVIFXiKN).

## W3: Needfinding
This week was about needfinding and getting an even better understanding of the project. 
Through the [affinity clustering](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/affinity%20clustering.md), each member of the group recapitulated the discussion with Ivan and wrote down first observations. This required each team member to think about the meeting and find words for this persional impressions. 
The Observations on the cards got grouped together to form categories of our choice. This process, and sharing the individual
thoughts on each cards, lead us to broughter insights on the situation.

[affinity clusering 4](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/affinity_clustering_4.jpeg).

We also invented three individual personas which should serve us as guidance. We created them such that they serve us as
target audience. By describing their situation and therefore their needs, we now have good reference when making decisions.
### The personas
[Jason](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20jesse.pdf), 27, a typical music student looking for an efficient way to study.  
[Alana](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20alana.pdf), 19, an ambitious high school student working towards a music competition while trying to have as much free time as possible.  
[Jennifer](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/persona%20jennifer.pdf), 34, a music teacher looking for a way to help her students even when she's not around.


## W4: Ideation

With the help of our personas and a basic understanding of our goal we could now explore the whole designspace we're in.
The idea is to [brainstorm](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/brainstorm.md): thinking in any direction without caring about implementability or any other real world problems. Since there
exist no bad ideas in this context, we had quite a bit of banter. ![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6Ztd5vx7mxQ4AkQU/giphy.gif)

From this we narrowed down and fleshed out three main prototypes. Since we already had a lot of ideas through the brainstorm and the work done in the weeks before, this task was relatively easy. The hardest part was dumping glorious thoughts which turned out to be not that promising after all. We still tried to create three totaly different prototypes. Each one should solve the problem in it's own way to not miss any perspective. The result was [presented](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/prototypes%20presentation.pdf) the week after in class to get a [first feedback](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/feedback_presentation.md). After minor changes the ideas of our prototypes were presented our stakeholder Ivan.


### W6: Prototypes
Like already said before, we created three main prototypes which could possible solve the goal. We tried to keep in mind our personas and the requirements we derived so far.  

[10-pi](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/ten-pi_app_prototype.pdf), an app with inbuild functionality to plan and keep track of ones progress.   

[bothofen](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_prototype.pdf), a small gadget providing deeper insight into the music played and a way to connect with peers or teachers. [sketch 1](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_skizze_1.png), [sketch 2](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_skizze_2.png), [sketch 3](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/bothofen_skizze_3.png),  

[pi-ano](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/pi-ano_prototype.pdf), a smart piano including pretty much everything the two prototypes above provide.  

After a short discussion with our stakeholder Ivan it was clear to everyone that the app serves our goal and that we'd focus on this prototype. It made sense to us due to it's easy deployment and because everyone knows instantly how to use it. Furthermore, most people carry their phone with them already most of the time and it is capable of solving what we expect it to. The other prototypes helped us gaining insight into how the goals could also be achieved if portability was not a criteria. Unforunately it is and therefore we thought that we may overshoot the goal with a self-contained physical instance, even though it could provide even more than an app.

We created multiple paper prototypes of the app to get a feel for it. See the prototypes here: [PP1](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_1.pdf), [PP2](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_2.pdf), [PP3](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_3.pdf), [PP4](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/paper_prototype_4.pdf).  
Each team member drew it's own paper prototype. Like this, each team member created it's own first app paper prototype unbiased. We created a [rough outline](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/prototyping_outline.md) so we could combine possibly good ideas more easily with each other. 
The result was a discussion of the result with each team member already having an own point of view. We sat down multiple times in the team, talking to potential future users in between, to get a feel what we need. In this stage the prototypes where still low-fi, which made the re-evaluation pretty easy.  
We started to code an own app, as the picture of the end software became more clear. Furthermore, we started to use reference of functionalities of already consisting apps. See here: [App impression 1](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/app_review_1.jpg), [App impression 2](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/app_review_2.jpg), [Sleeping App Reference](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/sleeping_app_review_1.jpg).

### W8: User Study

After reaching a coarse vision and prototype of our end product a user study would give us feedback on where we stand so far and what needs to be changed. The exercise was to design and conduct a user study/heuristic evaluation with our prototype. Like this we should asses the usability of our design.

We set up a study and evaluated it. The [Detailed Study Report](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/detailed_study_report.pdf) contains our hypothesis, the methods we checked those and a short summary. The [Study Evaluation](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/study_evaluation.pdf) shows the result of the study, statistics we extracted out of the data commented by us. We attained the data by conducting the tests desribed in the detailed study report and wrote down the result in an [Evaluation Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1mMPWOriXPx2D7pERDGj-8rZW28IvjL5L10zMLD73cyg/viewform?edit_requested=true). The raw data can be seen [here](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/excel_raw_study_data.pdf). 
TODO: @Oli, can you please upload a pdf file with the name excel_raw_study_data.pdf to content folder. There exist multiple versions on drive, i don't know which one is correct. Already linked it, should work with correct name...

The study was shortly [presented](https://github.com/eth-ait/hci-project-group-4/blob/master/content/study_presentation.pdf) to class and to our stakeholder Ivan along with the reports.
