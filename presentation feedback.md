# Ivan presentation feedback
Personas:
Jason and Alana are the personas he is looking for. Alana could represent even younger musicians which are ambitioned enough to take it seriously, but not main focus. Jennifer is not his primary group of interest, the teacher side is less important than the musicians side.

Prototypes:
Negatives:
- Github to sophisticated for what he has in mind, it seems to idealized to him
- Not everything should be recorded, user should be able to record if he's ready 

Positives:
+ Checklist
+ Having Project "Folders" to seperate between them
+ Sharing recordings with collegues
+ Show starting time of the exercise session
+ Diary with progress made on individual days
+ Comments on recordings
+ Gamification and rewards
 -> Get coins to buy giftcards of MusicHug, Concert or so
